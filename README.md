# ERWASM

erwasm is a compiler of Erlang language into WASM.

# What is this repo

Test folder had vitest-based units that run against compiled WASM code to make sure
stuff that is supposed to work still does.

This setup can be used as a demonstration of how interop between javascript and erlang compiled to wasm
works.
